<p>Mini Project 4 (Debugging) has been a painstaking learning efforts to validate the codings of the previous projects. It is interesting to note that codings can contain several errors that may impact negatively on the webpage, yet may go unnotice.  Through the validation exercise, I realized that most part of my previous projects contained several errors ranging from undefined characters through failure to close tags to missing tags. Unfortunately, the error messages were not as simple as anticipated to enable me fix those problems. The good things is that the course materials proved to be helpful in that respect.</p>
<p>Another difficulty I encountered has to do with arranging the files such that I could identify projects done prior to validation and those done after the validation. At a point,  what proved to be workable was to create new sets of two folders. One of the folders contained previous projects that presumably have error codings. The second folder contained copies of projects that have been validate. Other technical difficult was that the audio in my Mini Project 3 could not played after the codings of that project have been validated. Eventually, this problem was mitigated after recoding the link to the audio file as suggested in the validation proces.</p>
<p>The validation task, per this project, has been pretty much demanding. However, it has providesd an avenue for instropection when it comes to building a website that meets professional standards      </p>
