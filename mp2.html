<p>This project entails digital imaging. It demonstrates the skill sets to digitally create different scenarios from a primary source via Adobe Photoshop software. The significance of these skill sets is that helps to transform what otherwise would be mental imagery into actual visual images, a critical skill to examine "what if scenarios". In this exercise, two sets of images are used.</p>
<p>A detailed information on the images and the processes are provided below.</p>

<h2>First set image</h2>
<p>Birds come in varieties of colors, sizes, and also with other physical features. Indeed, they are a delight to watch. It is intersting to note how birds may have the same sizes yet have different other attributes including length of their beaks and head shapes. Sometimes you could imagine the possibility of taking the head of another bird and placing on that of the another. This is what I tried to do in this assignment. The images were downloaded from the archives of the National Geographic website. There was limited information about the photos. They were very big in their original form, and therefore could not have produced the expected output. They were first opened in Photoshop software and resized using first, the zoom in and out features. Using tools such as image size, the size of the photos were reduced from their original width and height of 1600 x1000 to 600x370. The resolution were maintained at 72. The filter tools (Gaussian Blur) was used to adjust the color of the original image. Using the quick selection tool, the head portion of the first bird was select and copied. On the destination photo, clone stamp was used to erase the head of the target bird before pasting the copied head of the another bird on it. The next steps included the application of the move tool (free transform), hue adjustment, and curve to modify the colors as desired. The new and the original images were saved first in Photoshop (PSD), jpg, and finally as web image. The images were named Before and After, and were uploaded to my mp2 folder</p>

<h2>Second set image</h2>
<p>Human mobility generates congestion, and at its peak can cause accidents or stampedes. Facilities are designed to ease the difficulties we encounter in our everyday movements. The advent of electronic technology precipitated the use traffic lights in addition to the existing design called round about. These two mechanisms continue to be the alternative options used by urban designers in their quest to enhance traffic flow without compromising urban aesthetics. In this photoshop exercise, I took two photographs of a roundabout that is located in front of the College of Arts and Sciences building and the traffic light adjacent to that building. I intended to look at which of the two traffic mechanisms can effectively enhance aesthetics whilst maintaining discipline regarding traffic flow. The photos were taking using an LG Android phone, after which they were download and saved on my Mp2 assignment folder on my computer. The sizes and resolution were modified to meet specifications using tools in photoshop such as Crop, Image Size, etc. The width and height were adjusted to 600x370 with the resolution of 72. The quick select tool was utilized to copy the photograph of the roundabout design. This was pasted on the photo of the traffic lights. The traffic lights and other features were erased using the clone tool to clone the sidewalks, parked cars, surrounding buildings, and trees. After this, the newly created layer was pasted on the cloned areas with transformation adjustments. Several color patters were looked at, and using the hue, a layer was created with colors that depicts a sunset environment. The original and the newly created images were saved as web images in my mp2 assignment folder.</p>
