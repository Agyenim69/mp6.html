<p>This page showcases digital video editing for website publication. The requirement was to take and edit videos on a classroom instructional activity or any school related activities. I opted to do a video depicting the beautiful landscape in front of the College of Arts and Sciences that shares boundaries with Bierce Library, Simon's Hall and College of Education. I was moved by the beautiful and the serene scenery, and envisaged how facinating it could be to have a short video showcasing the impact of the COVID 19 pandamic on what used to be the hub of campus activities. The video contains no audio commentary but captions that tell the story and project multimedia technology as the hope into the academic future.</p>
<p>Hardware used for this project were <span class="c3">Dell Computer, Apple iPad, and Action Cam SVC Series TLC HD</span>. The recorded video files were downloaded from the iPad and Action Cam SVC Series TLC camera to my computer using a USB cable. The original recordings from the two divices were examined to select the best video for the project. The video captured with iPad was deemed to be the best one to choose. I  edited the selected video using Any Video Converter and Windows Moviemaker software. I converted the video file into mpeg 4 using the Any Video Converter. Using the effects tools, I adjusted the brightness, contrast, and saturation effects to suit the objective here. The video size was to be maintained at 320x240. However, it was left at 480x320 due to quality issues. I then resorted to the Windows movie maker for more editing particularly with regards to the background music and features such as animation, captions, and formatting of the font sizes. I adjusted the noisy audio that came with the raw recording.</p>
<p>The final output of the project was validated using W3C XTML validation tools</p>
