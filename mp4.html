<p>Mini Project 4 (Debugging) has taken a huge part of me. The dilemma began with the validation exercise. At this point, I realized most part of my previous projects contained several errors ranging from undefined characters through failure to close to missing tags. Unfortunately, the error messages were not as simple as anticipated to enable me fix those problems. The good things is that the notes proved to be helpful in that respect. Another difficulty I encountered has to do with arranging the files such that I can identify prior validation assignments from those after the validation. At a point, the only option available for me was to redo the entire assignment again. I am still dealing with a huge problem of not having my audio in mini project 3 played again. Initially, everything seemed perfect. However, I opened the links again and there lies the quagmire. Though a task that required dedication, the end product imbues positive self-evaluation. I still envisage myself as beginner in the entire course. So far what have been accomplished, however little they may appear, remain a source of motivation to get to the ultimate end.</p>
